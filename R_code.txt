To install vegan package once only:
> install.packages(‘vegan’)

Partial Mantel Code:
RDM csv files should be uploaded to AWS s3 for ease loading.
> library(‘vegan’)
> random <- read.csv("./rdms/blurring/sigma_10/conv5/random_conv5.csv")
> f10s <- read.csv("https://cusacklab-web.s3.amazonaws.com/cmc_associations/finetune10s_rdm_conv5.csv")
> lch <- read.table("https://cusacklab-web.s3.amazonaws.com/cmc_associations/lch_df.txt")

Full Mantel test. Note the lch file loaded above doesn't include the headers so omit the indexing. This depends on data loaded.
> mantel(f10s[2:257],lch)

Partial Mantel, controlling for Random.
> mantel.partial(f10s[2:257],lch,random[2:257])
